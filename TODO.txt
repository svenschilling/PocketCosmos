- make hints for buttons !
- look into FadeTransitions()
-  loop sound only if press played 
- window size 1920x1080 sets inner graphics wrong
- rework timer_panel.png
- rework sunmode.png
- mb rework menu.png
- rework pause_pressed.png -> needs a play symbol
- right hand and left handed mode ! icons set on specific side then
- transition from main to play like a warp ?! build it from main_ and- play_ background

- x button hold for 3 sec asks for quitting the game when not in main menu , single lick goes one back
